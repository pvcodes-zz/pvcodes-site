      <h2>Alpha Particles</h2>

      <p>An alpha particle is a particle made up of two protons and two neutrons. Since this configuration is similar to
        that of a helium nucleus, it’s often referred to as a helium nucleus. The term is commonly used in nuclear
        physics, and is one of the three particles commonly emitted during a radioactive decay, i.e., alpha, beta, and
        gamma particles.</p>

      <p>Alpha particles gained prominence during the early days of particle physics when scientists used them as
        projectiles to bombard certain targets. One of the most widely celebrated experiments that made use of alpha
        particles was that of Ernest Rutherford’s that led to the discovery of the atom’s structure.</p>

      <p>Using alpha particles as projectiles and gold foils as targets, Rutherford was able to come to the conclusion
        that atoms were made up of very dense positively charged cores with the much lighter negatively-charged
        electrons orbiting around it. His conclusion was based on the observation that the trajectories of the alpha
        particles were slightly deviated (as expected) at most times but in rare instances bounced off like ping-pong
        balls thrown against a wall.</p>

      <h2>M Theory</h2>



      <p>In theoretical physics, M-theory is an extension of string theory in which 11 dimensions of spacetime are
        identified as 7 higher-dimensions plus the 4 common dimensions (11D st = 7 hd + 4D). Proponents believe that the
        11-dimensional theory unites all five 10 dimensional string theories (10D st = 6 hd + 4D) and supersedes them.
        Though a full description of the theory is not known, the low-entropy dynamics are known to be supergravity
        interacting with 2- and 5-dimensional membranes.</p>

      <p>This idea is the unique supersymmetric theory in 11 dimensions (11D), with its low-entropy matter content and
        interactions fully determined, and can be obtained as the strong coupling limit of type IIA string theory
        because a new dimension of space emerges as the coupling constant increases.</p>

      <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Calabi_yau.jpg/230px-Calabi_yau.jpg"></p>

      <p>Drawing on the work of a number of string theorists (including Ashoke Sen, Chris Hull, Paul Townsend, Michael
        Duff and John Schwarz), Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study suggested its existence at a
        conference at USC in 1995, and used M-theory to explain a number of previously observed dualities, initiating a
        flurry of new research in string theory called the second superstring revolution.</p>

      <p>In the early 1990s, it was shown that the various superstring theories were related by dualities which allow
        the description of an object in one super string theory to be related to the description of a different object
        in another super string theory. These relationships imply that each of the super string theories is a different
        aspect of a single underlying theory, proposed by Witten, and named "M-theory".</p>
